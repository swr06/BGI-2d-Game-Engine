# BGI-2d-Game-Engine
I made this game engine when I was about 12 years old. 
This engine is based on the WinBGIM library (A GDI implementation of the good ol' borland graphics library). 

# Using and trying it out
Just open with the .cbp (Code Blocks project file) and run it. It will only work with C++17. It supports sprites, objects, scenes, framerate, events and sound. 

Enjoy!
